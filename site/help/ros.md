## Introduction

> The Robot Operating System ([ROS](https://www.ros.org/)) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications.

## Configuration

``` sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

### Setup your keys

```sh
sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

### Installation

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

### Environment Setup

**Bash**

```sh
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

**zsh**

```sh
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc

```

### Dependencies for building packages

Up to now you have installed what you need to run the core ROS packages. To create and manage your own ROS workspaces, there are various tools and requirements that are distributed separately. For example, rosinstall is a frequently used command-line tool that enables you to easily download many source trees for ROS packages with one command.

To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```
